# Dynamic Programming

## What is it?
Breaking problems down into smaller pieces, then storing them to optimize later problem solving.

### Two Paradigms

**Top-down**
  - Build stacks and save work to cache as the problem breaks down
  - Memoization
  - Typical of recursion

**Bottom-up**
  - Uses base cases to build up to larger problems
  - Typical of iteration
