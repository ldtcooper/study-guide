# Scaling

## Scaling your Web App 101
  Notes on [this article](https://blog.hartleybrody.com/scale-load/).
  - With enough users, a web app will slow down -- that's how you know you've hit scale.
  - Don't scale before you need to! Making an app work for lots of people at once comes at a cost.
    - Introduces complexity and abstraction, making app harder to think through.
    - Longer time to add new features
    - Testing gets harder
    - Bugs become more difficult to find
